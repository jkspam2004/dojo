How to create a sample Pylot app development version:
1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder of your choice. Then run following commands:
git clone -b development https://github.com/Ketul-Patel/Pylot.git
2. Navigate inside Pylot folder:
cd Pylot
3. Run the setup file:
python setup.py
4. When notified that you have no exisiting virtual environment, and prompted if you would like to create on,  press "Y" and press enter key:
Y
5. The setup script will then setup virtual environment, and the virtual environment will be activated.  At this point, run setup file again:
python setup.py
6.  Run the server and open your localhost after that:
python manage.py runserver
All done :smiley:
