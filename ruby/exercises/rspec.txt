RSpec methods
There are a ton of useful RSpec methods. Here is a list of some very common ones and what they do.

describe : describe accepts a string or class. It is used to organize specs.
========
RSpec.describe SOME_CLASS do
end

it : it is what describes the spec. It optionally takes a string.
==
it 'SOME STRING' do
end

expect().to : expect().to is RSpecâ€™s assertion syntax.
=========== 
expect([].length).to eq(0)

expect().not_to : expect().not_to is the inverse of expect().to.
===============
expect([1,2,3,4].length).not_to eq(0)

before : before runs the specified block before each test. Helps you keep from repeating code.
======
before do
  @a = Array.new
end
expect(@a.length).to eq(0)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All together we can create an RSpec like so:

RSpec.describe Array do
  before do
    @a = Array.new
  end
  it 'tests the length of the array' do
    expect(@a.length).to eq(0)
  end
end
Make sure to play around with these various methods as they are common practice in RSpec. Fully understand them.
