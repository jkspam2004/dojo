'''
PART I
Create a Python class called MathDojo that has the methods  add and subtract. Have these 2 functions take at least 1 parameter. 

Then create a new instance called md. It should be able to do the following task:

MathDojo().add(2).add(2, 5).subtract(3, 2).result
which should perform 0+2+(2+5)-(3+2) and return 4.

PART II
Modify MathDojo to take at least one integer(s) and/or list(s) as a parameter with any number of values passed into the list. It should now be able to perform the following tasks:

MathDojo().add([1],3,4).add([3, 5, 7, 8], [2, 4.3, 1.25]).subtract(2, [2,3], [1.1, 2.3]).result
 should do 0+1+3+4+(3+5+7+8)+(2+4.3+1.25)-2-(2+3)-(1.1+2.3) and return its result.

PART III
Make any needed changes in MathDojo in order to support tuples of values in addition to lists and singletons.
