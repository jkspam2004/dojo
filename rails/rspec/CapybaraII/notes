test lives in spec/features/facebook_login_spec.rb
1. brew install chromedriver

2. add this to spec_helper.rb

Capybara.register_driver :selenium_chrome do |app|   
Â Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :chrome)
end

3. add this to facebook_login_spec.rb (edited)

Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_chrome (instead of setting current_driver

4. change test to say click_button instead of click_link_or_button
