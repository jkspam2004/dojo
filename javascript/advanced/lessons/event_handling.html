  <!-- 
Event Handling
Callbacks can be used to handle events

Remember how we said that Javascript uses an Event-Driven programming style? This means that we 
listen for events, trigger events, and keep track of a list of instructions to run when the event 
is triggered. As developers we take care of listening for events and passing the list of 
instructions to dictate what to do once the event is triggered. The user is usually the one to 
actually trigger the event.
