/*
Inside of the private method, this refers to the global Window or Node object (it depends in which environment you're running the script)! This is bad; you never want to mess with the built in globals because it can create very difficult-to-find bugs. There are a few different strategies we can use to make sure the this we're talking about inside a private method is the object instance.One way is to capture a snapshot of this and store it in a variable that you call something else, which any method (public or private) is free to reference.

/*
We declared a private variable self that hangs on to the Ninja object constructed when we call var Speros = new Ninja('Speros', 29, 'MBA');. To access the constructed object from within private methods we can then refer to self.

Usage of this with private variables can be challenging, especially when we are passing data from object to object. Itâ€™s good training to console.log(this); and console.log(self) // if you've declared it; while we work through this section! Instead of self, its not uncommon practice to use: var _this = this; or var my = this;.
